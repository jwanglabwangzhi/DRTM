# DRTM
Deep recognization TSSs of miRNA
## Welcome to DRTM! 
DRTM is a convenient, fast running Linux GUI software, the main function of it is to find the expressed miRNA transcription start site. In addition, it can do a fast peak calling and find intergentic miRNA which is always confusing, the use of different combinations can complete a variety of functions.

### 3 TSS finder
This part combines the first two steps with the Peak file and expressed intergenetic miRNA file, load the file with Peak suffix, press the RUN button, the results will be stored in the software directory . We suggest using macs developed by TaoLiu to get your Peaks will get better TSS results for miRNAS. (please download hg19.fa genome and put it into 'pre_loaded_file' folder.ï¼‰
